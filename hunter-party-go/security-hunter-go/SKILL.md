  Audit Go code for security vulnerabilities — hardcoded secrets, injection risks (SQL,
  command, template, path), missing input validation at trust boundaries, insecure defaults,
  auth gaps, sensitive data exposure, unsafe package usage, and weak crypto.

  Use when: reviewing Go code before deployment, auditing trust boundaries, preparing for
  a security review, onboarding third-party integrations, or hardening an application.

# Security Hunter

Audit code for **security vulnerabilities** — places where untrusted input flows into sensitive operations without
validation, secrets are embedded in source, defaults are permissive, or auth checks are missing. The goal: **every
trust boundary validates its inputs, no secrets live in code, and the principle of least privilege is applied
throughout.**

## When to Use

- Reviewing code before production deployment
- Auditing trust boundaries (API endpoints, gRPC handlers, webhooks, CLI input)
- Preparing for a formal security review or pen test
- Onboarding third-party integrations or new external data sources
- Hardening an application after a security incident

## Core Principles

1. **Trust boundaries are the perimeter.** Every point where external data enters the system — HTTP requests, gRPC
   calls, file uploads, environment variables, database reads, third-party API responses — is a trust boundary. Input
   must be validated, sanitized, or escaped before it flows into operations that could be exploited.

2. **Secrets belong in the environment, never in code.** API keys, passwords, tokens, certificates, and connection
   strings must come from environment variables, secret managers, or encrypted config — never from source files,
   comments, or committed config.

3. **Default to deny.** Defaults should be restrictive: CORS origins explicit not `*`, auth required not optional,
   permissions minimal not broad. Permissive defaults are the most common class of security misconfiguration.

4. **Defense in depth.** No single validation layer is sufficient. Validate at the boundary, escape at the output,
   enforce at the data layer. If one layer fails, another should catch the exploit.

5. **Fail closed.** When auth/authz checks fail or return errors, the result should be denial, not access. Error paths
   must not bypass security controls.

## What to Hunt

### 1. Hardcoded Secrets

API keys, passwords, tokens, or connection strings embedded directly in source code.

**Signals:**

- String literals matching key patterns: `sk_live_`, `AKIA`, `ghp_`, `Bearer `, `password=`
- Connection strings with embedded credentials: `postgres://user:pass@host`
- Base64-encoded strings in auth headers or config
- `.env` files or secret-bearing config committed to the repo
- Comments containing credentials ("temporary key: xyz123")
- `const` or `var` declarations with secret-looking values

**Action:** Move to environment variables or a secret manager. Add the pattern to `.gitignore`. Rotate any committed
secret immediately — it's already compromised if the repo was ever shared.

### 2. Injection Vulnerabilities

Untrusted input concatenated into strings that are interpreted as code, queries, or commands.

**Signals:**

- SQL: string concatenation or `fmt.Sprintf` in query strings instead of parameterized queries (`db.Query(sql, args...)`)
- Command injection: `exec.Command` with user-controlled arguments, especially via shell (`sh -c`)
- Path traversal: user input in `os.Open()`, `filepath.Join()`, or URL construction without canonicalization
- Template injection: user input rendered via `text/template` in a web/HTML context (no auto-escaping) instead of
  `html/template`. Note: `text/template` is fine for non-HTML output (config files, CLI output, code generation)
- LDAP injection: user input in LDAP filter strings
- Header injection: user input in HTTP response headers without sanitization
- Regex: user input passed directly to `regexp.Compile` (ReDoS risk)

**Action:** Use parameterized queries, allowlists, `filepath.Clean` + prefix checking, `html/template`, or regex
escaping. Never concatenate untrusted input into interpreted strings.

### 3. Missing Input Validation at Trust Boundaries

Endpoints, handlers, or integration points that accept external data without validation.

**Signals:**

- HTTP handlers that read `r.Body`, `r.URL.Query()`, or `r.FormValue()` without validation
- gRPC handlers that use request fields without validation
- File upload handlers without type/size/content validation
- Webhook handlers without signature verification (HMAC)
- CLI commands that use `os.Args` or flag values without validation
- JSON unmarshalling without struct tag validation or post-unmarshal checks

**Action:** Add validation at every trust boundary. Validate type, format, range, and length. Reject invalid input
explicitly — don't coerce or default.

### 4. Insecure Defaults and Configuration

Permissive defaults that weaken security posture when not explicitly overridden.

**Signals:**

- CORS: `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` or credentials with wildcard origin
- TLS: `InsecureSkipVerify: true` in `tls.Config`
- TLS: minimum version not set explicitly. Go 1.18+ defaults to TLS 1.2 minimum, but earlier versions default to
  TLS 1.0. Verify the project's minimum Go version; flag only when running Go <1.18 or when compliance requires
  explicit configuration
- HTTP server without timeouts (`ReadTimeout`, `WriteTimeout`, `IdleTimeout`)
- Cookie: missing `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, or `SameSite` attributes
- Rate limiting absent on auth endpoints or public APIs
- Debug endpoints or pprof exposed in production
- Permissive file permissions (`os.WriteFile` with `0666` or `0777`)

**Action:** Restrict defaults. Require explicit opt-in for permissive settings with justification.

### 5. Authentication and Authorization Gaps

Missing or inconsistent auth checks that allow unauthorized access or privilege escalation.

**Signals:**

- Routes/endpoints without auth middleware where peer routes have it
- Authorization checks that compare user IDs with string equality on user-controlled values
- Role checks using client-provided claims without server-side verification
- Admin functionality accessible by changing a URL parameter or request body field
- JWT validation without audience, issuer, or expiry checks
- Password handling: plain-text storage, weak hashing (MD5, SHA1), missing salting
- Session tokens without expiry, rotation, or revocation

**Action:** Ensure every endpoint has explicit auth/authz. Check authorization server-side against the session, not
client-provided claims. Use bcrypt/scrypt/argon2 for password hashing.

### 6. Sensitive Data Exposure

Personal data, secrets, or internal details leaked through logs, errors, responses, or storage.

**Signals:**

- Logging request bodies, auth headers, or user PII (`log.Printf("%+v", request)`)
- Error responses that include stack traces, internal paths, or database details
- API responses that return more fields than the client needs (no field filtering)
- Sensitive data in URLs (tokens in query parameters — logged by servers and proxies)
- Errors wrapped with `fmt.Errorf` that include sensitive context sent to clients
- `panic` stack traces exposed to clients in production

**Action:** Strip sensitive fields from logs and error responses. Use separate internal/external error messages. Recover
panics in HTTP middleware and return generic errors.

### 7. Unsafe Package and CGO Risks

Usage of `unsafe`, `reflect`, or CGO that bypasses Go's type safety and memory safety.

**Signals:**

- `import "unsafe"` outside of performance-critical, well-audited code
- `reflect` used to bypass unexported field access
- CGO code without input validation at the Go/C boundary
- `//go:linkname` directives accessing internal runtime functions
- `//go:nosplit`, `//go:noescape` pragmas without justification
- `unsafe.Pointer` arithmetic for memory manipulation

**Action:** Audit each usage. Ensure unsafe code is isolated, documented, and justified. Verify CGO boundaries validate
all inputs. Prefer pure Go alternatives where possible.

### 8. Concurrency Safety Issues

Race conditions, deadlocks, and resource leaks that can be exploited or cause denial of service.

**Signals:**

- Shared state accessed from multiple goroutines without synchronization (mutex, channel, atomic)
- `sync.Mutex` used inconsistently (locked in some paths but not others)
- Goroutines started without cancellation via `context.Context`
- Unbounded goroutine creation from user input (goroutine bomb / DoS)
- Channel operations that can deadlock under error conditions
- `sync.WaitGroup` with `Add` called in the wrong goroutine

**Action:** Use `-race` detector in tests. Protect shared state with appropriate synchronization. Bound goroutine
creation. Use `context.Context` for cancellation.

### 9. Dependency and Supply-Chain Risks

Module dependencies with known vulnerabilities or integrity issues.

**Signals:**

- `go.sum` not committed to the repo
- Dependencies with known CVEs (check via `govulncheck`)
- `replace` directives in `go.mod` pointing to local paths in production
- Using deprecated or unmaintained modules for security-sensitive operations
- Private modules fetched without `GONOSUMCHECK` / `GONOSUMDB` awareness (sumdb trust model)

**Action:** Commit `go.sum`. Run `govulncheck`. Pin dependency versions. Audit transitive dependencies for
security-sensitive code paths.

## Audit Workflow

### Phase 1: Map Trust Boundaries

1. **Resolve audit surface.** The prompt may specify the scope as:
   - **Diff**: files changed on the current branch vs base (`main`/`master`)
   - **Path**: specific files, folders, or packages
   - **Codebase**: the entire project
   If unspecified, default to **codebase**. For diff mode, resolve the file list:
   ```bash
   BASE=$(git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's@^refs/remotes/origin/@@' || echo main)
   SCOPE=$(git diff --name-only $(git merge-base HEAD $BASE)...HEAD)
   ```
   Constrain all subsequent scans to the resolved surface.
2. Identify trust boundaries: HTTP handlers, gRPC services, webhook endpoints, CLI argument parsers, config loaders.
3. Identify auth/authz middleware and where it's applied.

### Phase 2: Scan for Security Signals

```bash
EXCLUDE='--glob !**/vendor/** --glob !**/testdata/** --glob !**/*_test.go'

# Hardcoded secrets (common patterns)
rg --pcre2 '(sk_live_|AKIA|ghp_|password\s*=\s*"|secret\s*=\s*")' $EXCLUDE
rg --pcre2 '(postgres|mysql|mongodb)://\w+:\w+@' $EXCLUDE

# SQL injection: string formatting in queries
rg --pcre2 '(Query|Exec|QueryRow)\s*\(\s*(fmt\.Sprintf|".*\+|`.*\+)' --type go $EXCLUDE
rg 'fmt\.Sprintf.*SELECT|fmt\.Sprintf.*INSERT|fmt\.Sprintf.*UPDATE|fmt\.Sprintf.*DELETE' --type go $EXCLUDE

# Command injection
rg 'exec\.Command\s*\(' --type go $EXCLUDE
rg 'os/exec' --type go $EXCLUDE

# Path traversal
rg '(os\.Open|os\.ReadFile|os\.Create|ioutil\.ReadFile)' --type go $EXCLUDE

# Template injection (text/template used in web/HTML context — triage: check if output is served to browsers)
rg '"text/template"' --type go $EXCLUDE

# Insecure TLS
rg 'InsecureSkipVerify\s*:\s*true' --type go $EXCLUDE

# Unsafe package
rg '"unsafe"' --type go $EXCLUDE
rg 'go:linkname' --type go $EXCLUDE

# Weak crypto (math/rand is only a concern in security-sensitive contexts like token generation)
rg '"crypto/md5"|"crypto/sha1"' --type go $EXCLUDE
rg '"math/rand"' --type go $EXCLUDE

# Missing HTTP timeouts
rg 'http\.ListenAndServe|&http\.Server\{' --type go $EXCLUDE

# Sensitive data in logs
rg --pcre2 'log\.\w+\(.*\b(password|token|secret|authorization|cookie)\b' -i --type go $EXCLUDE

# File permissions
rg '0666|0777|os\.ModePerm' --type go $EXCLUDE

# pprof in non-debug code
rg 'net/http/pprof|runtime/pprof' --type go $EXCLUDE

# Regex from user input
rg 'regexp\.(Compile|MustCompile)' --type go $EXCLUDE

# Unbounded goroutines from user input
rg 'go\s+func|go\s+\w+\(' --type go $EXCLUDE
```

### Phase 3: Trace Data Flows

For each trust boundary found in Phase 1:

1. Does untrusted input pass through validation before reaching sensitive operations?
2. Are query parameters, body fields, and headers validated for type, format, and range?
3. Could a malicious input reach `exec.Command`, a SQL query, or template rendering?

### Phase 4: Evaluate Auth Coverage

1. List all routes/endpoints. For each: is auth middleware applied?
2. Identify authorization logic. Is it server-side? Does it rely on client claims?
3. Check session/token management: expiry, rotation, revocation.

### Phase 5: Produce Report

## Output Format

Save as `YYYY-MM-DD-security-hunter-audit-{$LLM-name}.md` in the project's docs folder (or project root if no docs folder exists).

## Recommendations (Priority Order)

1. **Critical**: {hardcoded secrets to rotate, injection vulnerabilities, auth bypasses}
2. **Must-fix**: {missing input validation, insecure defaults, auth gaps, dependency CVEs}
3. **Should-fix**: {sensitive data exposure, unsafe usage, concurrency issues, supply-chain hygiene}
```

## Operating Constraints

- **No code edits.** This skill produces an audit report only. Implementation is a separate step.
- **Scope: security vulnerabilities only.** Do not flag type safety (→ invariant-hunter-go), type design (→ type-hunter-go),
  structural complexity (→ simplicity-hunter-go), package boundary issues (→ boundary-hunter-go), interface design
  (→ solid-hunter-go), missing documentation (→ doc-hunter-go), test quality (→ test-hunter-go), or cosmetic style
  (→ slop-hunter-go). If a finding doesn't answer "could this be exploited?", it doesn't belong here.
- **Evidence required.** Every finding must cite `file/path.go:line` with the exact code.
- **Severity matters.** Use Critical / Must-fix / Should-fix. A hardcoded production secret is not the same severity
  as a missing `SameSite` cookie attribute. Prioritize accordingly.
- **Context over pattern-matching.** `regexp.MustCompile` with a hardcoded pattern is fine. `regexp.Compile(userInput)`
  is a ReDoS risk. Grep finds both — judgment separates them.
- **No false confidence.** This audit catches common patterns, not all vulnerabilities. It is not a substitute for
  professional penetration testing or automated security scanning.
